##### Q.1 (11 Points) Consider the proposition $((p{\rightarrow}q){\rightarrow}p){\rightarrow}q)$ 

</br>

###### (1) Construct the truth table for this proposition

</br>

###### (2) Show that this proposition is *not* logically equivalent to $p{\rightarrow}(q{\rightarrow}(p{\rightarrow}q))$

</br>

##### Q.2 (12 Points) For the following argument, explain which rules of inference areused for each step

"All students are hard-working. There is a student who will go to CMU.Therefore, there is a hard-working student who will go to CMU." The universeis "all members in CSE department".

##### Q.3 (9 points) If two sets $A$ and $B$ are both *uncountable* sets, then what kindof sets can$A \cap B$ be,*finite*,*countably infinite* or *uncountable*? Give examples to explain your answer

##### Q.4 (10 points) Consider the functionf : $\mathbb{R}^2{\rightarrow} \mathbb{R}^2$ defined as $(x,y){\mapsto}(2x−y,2y-x)$. Prove or disprove that $f$ is a bijective function.

</br>

##### Q.5 (12 points)

</br>

###### (1) Derive a formula in terms of $n$ for the summation $\sum_{i=1}^{n}{i \cdot 2^{-i}}$

###### (2) Give a formula for $\sum_{i \geq 1}{i \cdot 2^{-i}}$

##### Q.6 (10 points) For three positive integers $a$,$b$ and $k$, prove or disprove that

$gcd(ka,kb) = k \cdot gcd(a,b) $
</br>

##### Q.7 (12 points) Consider the numbers of the form $n^{13} − 2\cdot n^{7}+n$, wherenis aninteger. Determine for which values ofn, the number $n^{13} − 2\cdot n^{7}+n$ is divisible by 98

</br>

##### Q.8 (14 points) For a collection of balls, the number is not known

If we count them by 2’s, we have 1 left over;
by 3, we have nothing left;
by 4, we have 1 leftover;
by 5, we have 4 left over;
by 6, we have 3 left over;
by 7, we have nothingleft;
by 8, we have 1 left over;
by 9, nothing is left. 
How many balls are there?Give the details of your calculation

</br>

##### Q.9 (10 points) Recall the RSA public key cryptosystem: 

Bob posts a public key $(n,e)$ and keeps a secret key $d$, where $n$ is the product of two prime numbers. When Alice wants to send a message $0< M < n$ to Bob, she calculates $C=M^{e}$(mod $n$) and sends $C$ to Bob. Bob then decrypts this by calculating $C^{d}$(mod $n$). Given the value of $ \phi (n) = {7070}_8$ in *octal expansion* for $n= {7070}_8$ also in *octal expansion*. Can you factorize $n$, i.e., to find the values of $p$ and $q$? Explain your answer
